# One Step Backup v1.1

One Step Backup is a multi-platform, easy-to-use desktop utility to simplify the process of copying media files. It was created by Justin Winn and uses Qt 6.9.0. 

It supports the following file types:
Photos: {".jpg", ".jpeg", ".png", ".gif", ".bmp", ".tiff", ".webp"}
Videos: {".mp4", ".avi", ".mov", ".wmv", ".flv", ".mkv", ".webm"}
Documents: {".pdf", ".doc", ".docx", ".xls", ".xlsx", ".ppt", ".pptx"}
Audio: {".mp3", ".wav", ".flac", ".aac", ".ogg"}
Archives: {".zip", ".rar", ".7z", ".tar", ".gz"}

If you are building from source, ensure you have Qt 6.9.0 or later installed, as well as including the Core, Gui, Widgets, and SvgWidgets modules in your project if not using CMake.
